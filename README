# sfTwitterAuthPlugin #

## Installation and Usage ##

sfTwitterAuthPlugin provides Twitter authentication for your Facebook applications.
Thanks to OpenAuth, users never have to give you their Twitter credentials, and they
approve your app on a genuine twitter.com page.

This plugin requires sfDoctrineGuardPlugin as a starting point. sfGuardUser objects are created in the database for each Twitter user who has not been seen previously. The sfGuardUser username field will be set to the user's Twitter username.

To use this plugin, set up sfDoctrineGuardPlugin correctly, then set login_module to `sfTwitterAuth` and login_action to `login`.

Also, in `app.yml`, set your Twitter application apikey and secret:

    all:
      sfTwitterAuth:
        consumer_key: 'YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY'
        consumer_secret: 'YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET';
        success_signin_url: ... (optional)

You can get these via the (http://twitter.com/oauth_clients Twitter Applications Page). 

Now all actions that require authentication will force the user to log in via Twitter first. You can also log the user in explicitly by redirecting or forwarding them to the sfTwitterAuth/login action. 

Redirects should now be handled gracefully alike sfDoctrineGuardPlugin, to success_signin_url (if set), to referrer if there was one or to @homepage.

Once authenticated you can use the Twitter class to retrieve an instance of the current TwitterOAuth connection and perform API requests on behalf of the user like so:

    Twitter::getConnection()->get('users/search', array('q' => 'Steve Lacey'))
